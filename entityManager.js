/**
 * This physics system is a merely a first order approximation.
 * 
 * First, entities are moved based on their current velocities. (This happens
 * inside the update() method) Any accelerations are also applied at this stage.
 * 
 * Second, entities are run through a single iteration of a collision-response 
 * cycle. A typical response is to displace the entity along the response 
 * vector, and adjust the velocity accordingly. It is posible that at the end 
 * of this step entities have, as a result of two collision responses, twice 
 * displaced themselves and ended up intersecting with another entity. However,
 * as long as the density of physics objects is kept to a minimum, this 
 * shouldn't be a problem. 
 * 
 * Finaly, the entities are drawn to the screen.
